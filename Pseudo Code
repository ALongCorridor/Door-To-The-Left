LEFT DOOR  
print wise decision 
wait 1 second
print you're in a square room with two flickering candles on a table in the centre 
wait 1 second
print you also see some splodges of blood and a small note with some scribbled writing on it
wait 1 second 
print you approach the table, would you like to read the note?
if yes:
  print the note says
  wait 1 second
  Ah you seem to be following me? If you want to progress silence the flickering lights.
else:
`   print a breeze approaches you from behind and kills the dying candles
    wait 1 second 
    print the lights are dead and you feel like you're being watched
    wait 1 second
    print suddenly a dark figure jumps at you and striking your soft head, you fall to the floor and die a slow death
